#### **Custom-Entities** - Extract custom entities

In addition to other natural language processing capabilities, Azure AI Language Service enables you to define custom entities, and extract instances of them from text. To test the custom entity extraction, weâ€™ll create a model and train it through Azure AI Language Studio, then use a command line application to test it.

#### **Speech** - Recognize and synthesize speech

Azure AI Speech is a service that provides speech-related functionality, including:
- A speech-to-text API that enables you to implement speech recognition (converting audible spoken words into text).
- A text-to-speech API that enables you to implement speech synthesis (converting text into audible speech).

This example uses both of these APIs to implement a speaking clock application.
