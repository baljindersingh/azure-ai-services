# Azure AI Services
Repository for python code implementing different Azure AI Services
---

#### ⭐ **Custom-Entities** - Extract custom entities

In addition to other natural language processing capabilities, Azure AI Language Service enables you to define custom entities, and extract instances of them from text. To test the custom entity extraction, we’ll create a model and train it through Azure AI Language Studio, then use a command line application to test it.

#### ⭐ **Translate-Text** - Translate Text

Azure AI Translator is a service that enables you to translate text between languages. This example uses this service to create a simple app that translates input in any supported language to the target language of your choice.

#### ⭐ **Speech** - Recognize and synthesize speech

Azure AI Speech is a service that provides speech-related functionality, including:
- A speech-to-text API that enables you to implement speech recognition (converting audible spoken words into text).
- A text-to-speech API that enables you to implement speech synthesis (converting text into audible speech).

This example uses both of these APIs to implement a speaking clock application.

#### ⭐ **Speech-Translation** - Translate Speech

Azure AI Speech includes a speech translation API that you can use to translate spoken language. For example, suppose you want to develop a translator application that people can use when traveling in places where they don’t speak the local language. They would be able to say phrases such as “Where is the station?” or “I need to find a pharmacy” in their own language, and have it translate them to the local language.
